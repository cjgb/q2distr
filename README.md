# q2distr: Quantiles to distributions

This is a simple Streamlit app to visually get distribution parameters from their quantiles.

It's intended use is to fit Bayesian models with informative priors. Usually, one has certain idea of the possible ranges of a parameter but translating them into the actual distribution parameters is time consuming. This app facilitates such calculations.

The range of available distributions is very limited. New distributions could/will be added in the future. Contact the author in case you are interested in a particular one (or feel free to fork the repo yourself, of course).
